                    Taking the cultivation world by storm: Sect Leader Jin Rulan, Young Master Ouyang Zizhen, and Lan disciples Lan Jingyi and Lan Sizhui just go married last month. Yes, you didn't read it wrong, the four of them married each other. Since then, it was reported that Lan Qiren had a heartattack with the news, and it's been taken care by his nephew and Sect Leader, Lan Xichen. Meanwhile, Sect Leader Jiang flew straight to LanlingJin to confront his nephew, Sect Leader Jin, who got in front of his husbands to protect them from Sandu Shengshou's wrath. Everything is fine now, because he can't say no to his nephew's wishes.

                        Sexy, free and single

                        Are you single? We got you! Here's a list of the most handsome men (all single!) ranked by an anonymous source. At 1st we have Lan Qiren, an old not so old man, super wise, but not so tolerant; He loves morals and rules (so many rules, it's boring); if you're looking for a sugar daddy, you're in the wrong place, because although he's single, the only thing he wants is grandchildren. In 2nd place we have Lan Xichen, one of the Twin Jades of Gusu, and current Sect Leader of GusuLan; he's a little bit traumatized by his ex that died in a temple almost trying to kill him, but he'll get through it, he just needs a little time to ajust; He loves his brother and will do anything for his happiness. The 3rd one is the great Sandu Shengshou, the Sect Leader of YunmengJiang: Jiang Wanyin; He's fierce, and a little tough, but with (a lot of) patience and time, you can get to his heart; also, he dedicates all of his being to his Sect and his nephew, the Sect Leader of LanlingJin, Jin Rulan. The 4th one is the Ghost General, Wen Qionglin; he seems scary on the outside (since he's not actually alive and has killed many people a long time ago, although he was being controlled by someone else when he did so) but he's a really sweet and loyal guy who loves his family and friends.

                        Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian had returned to GusuLan for the first time since they started night-hunting together. All the disciples gathered in front of the Jingshi and they were so shocked to see the Second Twin Jade of Gusu smiling wide to his husband, for it was the first time seeing it, that they had to take a picture.

                        Are you prepared for a night-hunt? Come to Cloud Recesses to prepare yourself even more! Beware, there might be some (4 thousand) rules you can't break. But, hey, at least you can see some bunnies when you take a break between classes, right?

                    Many people ask me how do I deal with leading a Sect - QingheNie, if you just woke up in someone else's body and didn't know anything that happen in the last 16 years - and this journal. It's simple: I don't.

                    It's no secret to anyone that Cloud Recesses has a huge amount of bunnies since Wei Wuxian brought them to Lan Wangji and they couldn't stop breeding, which caused Lan Qiren do almost have a Qi deviation. But reliable sources confirmed that every morning the Lan Elder go feed them with a smile on his face.

                    In today's "In Memoriam" we pay our condolences to Wen Qing, loving sister and one of the greatest doctors of all times. She strongly protected her brother, Wen Qionglin, and her clan the best she could. Also, she was the first doctor to ever succesfully transfer a golden core from one person to another, even when it had only 50% of chances to succeed. May her soul rest in peace.
